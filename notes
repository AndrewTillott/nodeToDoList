Split the code up into logical files or modules. We are going to use an MVC structure

Which means we will split it into Models, Views and Controllers


M stands for Model 

(Model is just our data, (the list items on the todolist)) 

e.g. Todo's, Users 

V stands for View 

(What is sent to the user, a view for the todo list)

e.g. todo.ejs account.ejs

C stands for Controller

(Controls certain sections of the app. E.g. it could control the todo-section: it would grab the data from the model from the )

e.g. todoController userController

In our instance it is where the the javascript goes that controlls the to do list e.g. manipulate the data, handle routes etc
